<p>About Me

  Hi, I’m Ashley LeBoeuf, a passionate web developer who thrives on creating sleek, functional,
  and user-friendly websites. My journey into web development started with a curiosity for how websites work,
  and it quickly turned into a full-fledged career that allows me to merge creativity with problem-solving.
  
  With 5 years of experience, I specialize in front-end development, crafting responsive designs with
  modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.
  I also have a solid understanding of back-end technologies such as Node.js, Express, and database management
  with MongoDB and MySQL, enabling me to build full-stack applications.
  
  Beyond the technical skills, I pride myself on effective communication and collaboration,
  ensuring that client visions are translated into pixel-perfect, high-performing websites.
  Whether it's building an e-commerce platform, optimizing a website for SEO, or creating a custom web app,
  I approach each project with dedication and a user-first mindset.
  
  When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring design trends, tinkering with new technologies,
  or honing my skills in writing code and developing projects.
  I'm excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your next project. Let’s create something amazing together!
